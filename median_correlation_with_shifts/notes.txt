This directory was created in Nov 10. 

Tan copied the code to generate correlations at /data/nil-external/dcl/Events152_fMRI_NeuralMechanisms/voxelwiseAnalyses/knitr/newMatlabCorrelations_dtFixed
and change names of the scripts while keeping knitted files (for reference later). Also copied correlations between parcels and movie stats, parcels and PE to movieStatCorrs and PECorrs

format of correlation files:
"sub.id" "start.at" "p1" "p2" ...
"1" "sub-01" "corrAt0" 0.0494188534819104 0.0573702682205282 ...

UPDATE Nov 28:
Tan cleans up and restructure this directory a bit. (old files were moved to archive)

For all movies, Tan copied raw pe stat and put them in movie_pe_stat/ and raw visual (cleaned of artifact) stats and put then in movie_visual_stats/ 
	from BOX: C:\Users\nguye\Box\DCL_ARCHIVE\Documents\Events\exp152_fMRIneuralmechanisms\exp152_Session_2\movies\
These stats are input for convolution code (doResample.m and convo_pe.m) to generate HRF for these raw signals. 
Convoluted HRF scores are at out_convo_pe/ and out_convo_visual/. These scores were copied from Penfield: /data/nil-external/dcl/Events152_fMRI_NeuralMechanisms/voxelwiseAnalyses/matlab_resampling2

R script Feature_Parcel_Correlations.rnw calculates correlation between movie signals (visual stats or pe) and parcel-average timeseries and save them at {Visual/PE}Corrs_1_500 where 1 is the start TR and 500 is the last TR (a movie has typically 400TRs, so 1_200 means the first half of the movie. 500 > max(#TRs) so it'll be the whole movie)
format of correlation files for reference:
"sub.id" "start.at" "p1" "p2" ...
"1" "sub-01" "corrAt0" 0.0494188534819104 0.0573702682205282 ...
